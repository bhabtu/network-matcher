A tool to identify and prioritize tech-related LinkedIn connections for warm intros and referral outreach during the job search process.

## Overview:
This project helps job seekers streamline their referral outreach process by analyzing LinkedIn connections. It identifies which contacts work at tech-related companies, prioritizes them based on their roles (e.g. Software Engineer vs. tech-adjacent), and generates personalized messaging templates based on your relationship strength. Built to reduce job search paralysis and make outreach more strategic and intentional.

## Feature Plan:
- Parses your LinkedIn Connections CSV (skipping metadata rows)
- Uses AI to determine whether a contact’s company is tech-related
- Scores each connection’s role by relevance to software engineering
- Sorts and groups contacts by company and relevance
- Allows you to manually assign connection strength: Close, Familiar, or Distant
- Automatically generates personalized outreach messages for each connection
- Produces a clean, organized CSV ready for outreach planning
